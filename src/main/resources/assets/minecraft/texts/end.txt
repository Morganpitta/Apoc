§cIn the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood.

§cHe chose the path of perpetual torment.

§cIn his ravenous hatred he found no peace, and with boiling blood he scoured the umbral plains, seeking vengence afgainst the dark lords who had robbed him.

§cAnd those that tasted the bite of his sword named him...

§cThe Doom Slayer.

§cTempered by the fires of hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak.

§cHe set forth without pity, and hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty.

§cUnbreakable, incorruptible, unyeilding.

§cNone could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer, for he alone was the Hellwalker.

§cThey knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked.

§cThe Doomslayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realm.

§cDespair spread before him, like a plague, striking fear into the shadow dwellers, driving to deeper and darker pits.

§cHis power grew. Swift and unrelenting.

§cBlinded by his fervour, the lure drew him in.

§cThe priests entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus.

§cThe mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed.

§cAnd here he lies still.

§cEvermore, in silent... suffering.
